# Random winner raffle made with React-Native

This project was initially built for [my talk about React Native](http://bit.ly/lets-talk-react-native) I gave at [Meetup Front-end Campinas](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/campinas-frontend/events/240486790/).

It's a React-Native mobile app that can be used to raffle winners during presencial events.

## Motivation
Usually [random.org](https://www.random.org/) is used but it's kind of "boring" so you can use this instead!

## Setup
1. Checkout React-Native pre-requisites [installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

## Usage
1. Clone the project
1. Run _yarn_ or _npm_ install to download dependencies
1. Run _react-native run-ios_ or _react-native run-android_

Obs: Attendees list is a local file named [_members.json_](./assets/members.json) inside assets folder.

## How to contribute
Fork the project, check out if there is any [opened issues](../../issues) to see if you can help and submit a PR.
